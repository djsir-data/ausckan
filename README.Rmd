The goal of ausckan is to simplify the process of searching for data on Australia's State and Federal CKAN based repositories. In Australia, along side the Federal https://data.gov.au/ every State and Territory maintain a CKAN API except ACT and Tasmania. 

The wonderful [ckanr](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr) package already wraps the CKAN API and ausckan accesses API's via ckanr. ausckan is a very simple package with 2 purposes:

1. Make the Australia CKAN repositories more easily available
2. Narrow the gap between searching CKAN and getting a list of direct URL's to available data sets



## Installation

You can install the development version of ausckan like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("djpr-data/ausckan")
```
